# Clicker Game in Typescript

This is a project made by me to understand the fundamentals of typescript with contrast to the react framework. 

This project is a simple clicker game in which you have 5 health points and your task is to hit the randomly generating balls in the giant box in the middle, if you failed to do so your health will decrease until 0, in which case you lost, while hitting the ball will result in an increase in your score.
